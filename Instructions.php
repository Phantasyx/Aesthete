        <p>
    A player always has five available pipes. Each turn they can select one of the pipes using the radio button next to it. <br>
            Then they can rotate it as many times as they like, then click on an open space that extends their pipe. They can only add a <br>
            pipe where it will connect to their pipes. No other locations will work. This is, in fact, all of the locations where the <br>
            player's pipe currently leaks.<br><br>
    If they press discard, the selected pipe section is discarded and the turn ends.<br><br>
    Give up indicates that a player gives up.<br><br>
    If player has a completely connected pipe, they press Open Valve to turn on the steam. If there is a leak in their pipe, they lose.<br>
            If they have successfully connected the source to the destination, they win.<br>
            If you place tiles that would create steam off the screen (out of the grid), then you will not be able to cover up later. Be warned!!!<br>
